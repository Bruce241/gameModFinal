### Bloons Tower Defense in Quake 2
###### *When the game begins, a help screen will show up for 15 seconds detailing some of the following information.*
This mod is meant to be a remake of Bloons TD in Quake 2.\
It is unfinished, but it has elements of a tower defense game that can be used once the TD game mechanics are made.\
Five of the weapons are turned into "monkey" spawners, and you can shoot each weapon to spawn a different monkey.\
The other five weapons can be bought by the player by pressing keys 'u','i','o','p', costing 200, 300, 400, and 500 money respectively, and used to fight off the enemies.\
Press the "Delete" key to give yourself the five weapons to spawn the monkeys and some starting cash.\
In order to test out the "bloons" in the game, press keys 'c','v','b','n','m' to spawn them in.
